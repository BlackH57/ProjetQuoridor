# ProjetQuoridor
In perspective of Sorbonne University PIMA classes, we must develop a game named Quoridor.

Quoridor is a 9x9 plate game opposing 2 or 4 players. We will considerate the 2 players variante.
The objective of the game is to reach the other side of the board before your opponent reach your's. 
Each turn you can whether move or place a wall between two case to block your opponent in his path.
It is important to notice you cannot "close" your opponent path, there must be always a path from one side to the opposit one.

Our first objective is to emulate the game using Python. Then we shall work on few algorithm like pathfinding, create an agent who play random moves.
Our final goal is to create a fine AI who can play well and maybe even learn how to play.
